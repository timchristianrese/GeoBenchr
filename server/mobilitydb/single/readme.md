# Installation 
The installation assumes a clean Debian 10 installation, therefore some very basic utilities are also installed. Adjust as you see fit. 
The shell script provided here will setup PostgreSQL 17, PostGIS 3, and MobilityDB in its latest deployment (as of Jan 26, version 1.3).
Simply run the shell script on the server where you want to deploy the database system to.
