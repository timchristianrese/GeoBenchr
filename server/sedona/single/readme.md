# Installation
This installation has been tested on a Debian 10 installation, should however work for most Linux distributions out of the box.  
In order to install SedonaDB, `python` and `pip` are required. After successful installation, SedonaDB can simply be installed using
```
pip install "apache-sedona[db]
``` 
Should this for some reason not work, please refer to the [installation guide](https://sedona.apache.org/sedonadb/latest/)
