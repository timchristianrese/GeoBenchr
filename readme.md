# GeoBenchr
Welcome to GeoBenchr, an application-centric benchmarking suite for spatiotemporal database platforms. In our current work, we evaluate several systems with three unique application scenarios based on real-world spatiotemporal data, and compare platform performance across these domains.
### Included Scenarios
As of now, GeoBenchr provides application scenarios for an aviation, cycling, and ais application. We provide several queries with which we evaluate system performance, and compare different data scales, scalability factors, configuration parameters, and cross-platform performance.
## Evaluated Databases
As of now, GeoBenchr supports the following database systems:
- SedonaDB
- PostGIS
- SpaceTime
- TimeScaleDB
- MobilityDB

## Results
Some of the results can already be found in the paper (Arxiv link here soon)
